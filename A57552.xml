         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THough I confeſs I have long had it in my thoughts, to prove,</hi> That the Doctrine of the Laudenſian facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not the Doctrine of faith of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that the greateſt Conformiſts to the Ceremonies, are the greateſt Nonconformiſts in deed and in truth, to the Doctrine of faith, <hi>or the articles of Religion of the Church of England,</hi> concerning the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the true Chriſtian faith, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments; <hi>yet I ſate ſtill, earneſtly expecting that ſome one Orthodox Conformiſt, or other (whom it moſt concerned to maintain it) would appear to prove the former, or ſome learned Nonconformiſt to the Ceremonies, would do the latter: but neither ſeeing nor hearing of any one of them to attempt either the one or the other, being incouraged by the Parliaments late Act for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Tranſubſtantiation, I have (though the unfitteſt of a thouſand) adventured to renounce not only that blaſphemous Doctrine, but many more of the</hi> Papiſts <hi>erroneous and Antichriſtian Doctrines; and in doing of this, may poſſibly be thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obliquely, if not directly, to do them both. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with renouncing their abominable Tranſubſtantiation, partly becauſe the Parliament did ſo, and alſo becauſe it's not only deſtructive of the humane nature of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo inductive of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords-ſupper, and the Tables or Altars whereon 'tis celebrated; Several of our high Conformiſts having ſo beld (and 'tis feared that ſome do ſo now) the preſence of Chriſts Body in the Sacrament of the Altar, (as they have been pleaſed to call it) that they might well be thought to hold it after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the</hi> Papiſts <hi>or</hi> Lutherans <hi>Doctrine; for 'tis clear, that they have not only been againſt Orthodox mens diſcovery of the way that Chriſts body is</hi> not <hi>in</hi>

high Altar; and it is <hi>as poſitive and as much external reverence</hi> as is given to God himſelf, or would be given to Chriſt himſelf, if he were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally preſent on the Table; and it is the ſame for ſubſtance that Idolaters give to their Altars, Images and Idols: and <hi>it is divine ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration when we bow the body upon ſome divine cauſe,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith in his Idolatry of the laſt times, <hi>p.</hi> 824.

The commandment of God is to deſtroy the Idols of the heathen, their altars, and their high places,</hi> Exod. 34. 13. Now 'tis acknowledged by A.

                  <note place="margin">* Canon <hi>7th.</hi> made <hi>Anno</hi> 1640.</note> 
                  <hi>from the groſs ſuperſtition of the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>it was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provided, that all means ſhould be uſed to root out of the minds of people both the inclination thereto, and the memory thereof, eſpecially of the Idolatry committed in the Maſs, for which cauſe ell Popiſh altars were demoliſhed.</hi> Now I pray is it an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means to do theſe two things, <hi>to ſet up altars of wood in their places, or tables of wood altarwiſe,</hi> as the <hi>Laudenſians</hi> would have, and bow to or towards them, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> did and do? is this according to Gods Commandment.</p>
               <p>But before I go further, to prevent miſtakes, I ſay, that 'tis one thing for men to kneel or bow before or towards a place, <hi>meerly as a place,</hi> and another thing to bow or kneel towards or to a place or thing, <hi>purpoſely and upon a religious reaſon or reſpect, for ſome religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency or holineſs that is in it, or conceived to be in it more than in another place or thing.</hi> To kneel or bow towards or before a place or thing the former way, is <hi>neceſſary</hi> or unavoidable as to the action, it cannot be done without it: for a man cannot kneel or bow, but ſome place or thing will be before him, as is to be ſeen in prayer in the Church or field, or private houſe; but as to the perſon kneeling or bowing, 'tis <hi>accidental and beſides his intention:</hi> he kneels not, he bows not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65519:21"/>
before or towards his feat, the Pultpit, Pew, Eaſt or Weſt, North or South, out of any <hi>religious reſpect</hi> to the ſeat or place, or <hi>becauſe he thinks there is more religious excellency or holineſs in it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is more preſent there,</hi> or that way, than in another place or thing, or way; but only becauſe his ſeat or Pew is ſo placed, that he cannot conveniently ſtand or kneel otherwiſe ſo well as that way. Now in this or this way there is no Idolatry or ſuperſtition to bow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or before the Communion-Table, or Eaſt, in time of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip. But now your bowing once or twice, or three times, at your entrance into the Church, and ſo often when you come in ſight of the holy Altar, and <hi>three times</hi> when you come <hi>near it,</hi> and <hi>three times</hi> when ye <hi>go out of,</hi> or <hi>paſs through the</hi> Church or Chancel, or by the holy Altar, and this too when the Sacrament is not adminiſtred, is not caſual, accidental, or neceſſary, but <hi>purpoſed and intended in a religious reſpect to that place or thing,</hi> not ſimply as towards a place, but as to an holy place, yea <hi>more holy than other places;</hi> becauſe you <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt to be moſt ſpecially proſent there,</hi> and upon religious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which are not found to be in it by any inſtitution of God; which renders your worſhip ſuperſtitious, making it an <hi>image</hi> or <hi>means</hi> of worſhip, againſt the ſecond Commandment.

               <p n="1">1.

Now it is moſt certain that we are all by nature ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and before the judgment-ſeat of God convicted of ungodlineſs, and guilty of death; but we are juſtified, that is, acquitted from ſin and death by God the Judg, through the grace of Chriſt alone, and not by any reſpect or merit of ours. For what is more plain than that which</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, All have ſinned, and are deſtitute of the glory of God, and are juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus; for Chriſt took upon himſelf, and bare the ſins of the world, and did ſatisfie the juſtice of God. God therefore is merciful unto our ſins for Christ alone, that ſuffered and roſe again, and doth not impute them to us; but he imputeth the juſtice of Chriſt unto us for our own; ſo that now we are not only cleanſed from ſin, and purged, and holy, but alſo endued with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, yea and acquitted from ſin, death and condemnation; finally we are righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and heirs of eternal life. To ſpeak properly then, it is God alone that juſtifieth us, and that only for Chriſt, by not imputing to us our ſins, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting Chriſts righteouſneſs unto us. But becauſe we do receive this Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, not by any works, but by faith in the mercy of God, and in Chriſt: therefore we teach and believe with the Apoſtle, that ſinful man is juſtified only by faith in Chriſt, not by the Law, or by any works. For the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> Rom. 3. <hi>We conclude that a man is juſtified by faith without the works of the Law.</hi> To which they add, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2, 3. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8, 9. and ſay further, <hi>Therefore becauſe faith doth apprehend Chriſt our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and doth attribute all to the praiſe of God in Chriſt, in this reſpect Juſtification is attributed to faith, chiefly becauſe of Chriſt, whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth, and not becauſe it is a work of ours; for it is the gift of God. Now that we do receive Chriſt by faith, the Lord ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at large,</hi> Joh. 6. <hi>where he putteth eating for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi>

And moreover, our charity and our works cannot pleaſe God, if they be done of ſuch as are not juſt; wherefore we muſt firſt be juſt, before we can love or do any juſt works. We are made juſt (as we ſaid) through faith in Chriſt, by the meer grace of God, who doth not impute unto us our ſins, but imputeth unto us the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, yea and our ſaith in Chriſt is imputed for righteouſneſs unto us.</hi>

Faith thus receiving and reſting on Chriſt and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, is the alone inſtrument of Juſtification; yet it is not alone in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon juſtified, but is ever accompanied with all other ſaving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love.</hi>

For that were to count our ſelves to be juſtified by ſome act or vertue that is within our ſelves; but the true meaning thereof is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we hear Gods word, and believe it; although we have faith, we muſt renounce the merit of our ſaid vertues, &amp;c.</hi> And in the Homily of Chriſts Death and Paſſion, <hi>T. 2. part 2. p.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this true Chriſtian faith, neither Devil hath, nor yet any man, which in the outward profeſſion of his mouth, and in his outward receiving of the Sacraments, in coming to the Church, and in all other outward appearances, ſeemeth to be a Chriſtian man, and yet in his living and deeds ſheweth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</q>

And alſo <hi>p.</hi> 22. <q>There is a twofold faith: 1. Dead, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth no good fruits, but is idle and unfruitful, and is the faith of Devils, and of wicked men, who confeſs God with their mouths, but deny him in their deeds. He believeth the Scriptures to be true, but truſteth not in God for the performance of the Promiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. He believeth not in God, and truſteth not in his mercy and grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. <q>A lively Faith is not idle or unfruitful, but worketh by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And this is not the common belief of the Articles of our Faith, but 'tis alſo a true truſt and confidence of the mercy of God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Nothing ſo much commendeth men to God, as this aſſured Faith and truſt in him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By which we may ſee, 1. That <hi>Faith juſtifieth</hi> not, as it <hi>barely aſſents</hi> to the word of God; which may be proved thus: That is no act of Faith as 'tis juſtifying which Devils and wicked men may have; but aſſent to the word of God, Devils and wicked men may have; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a bare aſſent to the word, is no act of Faith as juſtifying. The Major is undeniable; the Minor is not only affirmed by our Church in the ſaid Homily, but may be proved by <hi>Jam. 2. 19. Thou believeſt that there is one God, thou doſt well; the Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> And that wicked men may have ſuch faith, may be ſeen in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 14.

Wherefore they which be endued with ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a benefit of God, be called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods purpoſe by his Spirit, working in due ſeaſon: they through grace obey the calling: they be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely: they be made Sons of God by adoption: they be made like the Image of his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt: they walk religiouſly in good works, and at length by Gods mercy they attain to everlaſting felicity: As the godly conſideration of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and our election in Chriſt, is full of ſweet, pleaſant, and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comfort to godly perſons, and ſuch as feel in themſelves the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of Chriſt, mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the works of the fleſh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their minds to high and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, as well becauſe it doth greatly eſtabliſh and confirm their faith of eternal ſalvation, to be injoyed through Chriſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth fervently kindle their love towards God.</q>

That the word <hi>(for)</hi> doth not always ſhew the <hi>cauſe</hi> of a thing, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it renders the <hi>reaſon</hi> of a thing, which reaſon may be drawn from the <hi>effect;</hi> as 'tis in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47. <hi>Her ſins are forgiven, for ſhe loved much;</hi> where by <hi>(for)</hi> is ſhewed not the <hi>cauſe why,</hi> but the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to prove, <hi>that</hi> her ſins were forgiven; <hi>For ſhe loved much.

of God: the Minor, <hi>viz. that they were merciful for Chriſts ſake, to Chriſts Members and Miniſters,</hi> Chriſt proves by their works; <hi>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat,</hi> &amp;c. So that here you may ſee that the Particle <hi>for</hi> is not uſed here <hi>cauſally,</hi> but <hi>rationally;</hi> it doth not declare the <hi>cauſe</hi> of their ſalvation, but it declares a <hi>reaſon to prove that they were the bleſſed Children of God, and heirs of the kingdom of heaven: for,</hi> he here proves their election, <hi>quoad quod ſit,</hi> but not <hi>quoad curſit, that they were elected,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but not why they were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;</hi> and therefore it makes nothing for the proof of <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Patricks</hi> Doctrine.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine, <hi>that Chriſt hath merited, that our good works might merit,</hi> is <hi>one of Antichriſt's deluſions,</hi> to be taken heed of, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11. leſt we be induced to <hi>believe a lie,</hi> that is the <hi>whole Antichriſtian Faith and Religion,</hi> which is a <hi>complicated lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This Doctrine of theirs implies, either that Chriſt hath <hi>not ſufficiently merited eternal life for us,</hi> or that our meriting is <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>needleſs;</hi> for that which is ſufficiently done to that end by Chriſt, needs not that it ſhould be done again by us to that end.</p>
               <p>3. That whatſoever Papiſts ſay to the contrary, 'tis evident, that <hi>they do divide the glory of meriting eternal life between Chriſt and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> becauſe they give it not <hi>ſolely</hi> to that grace that is <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>alſo</hi> to that grace that doth inhere <hi>in us,</hi> or is done by us; to which alſo they aſcribe our juſtification.

               <p>To all this I might urge an argument <hi>ad homines,</hi> which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, though not us, and ſay, that Papiſts muſt hold, if not this truth with us too, yet more, <hi>that Saints even in this life, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> elſe their juſtification by their own habitual righteouſneſs, and their meriting eternal life by their own good works, and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfilling the law; will fall to the ground: if there remain ſome ſins in the ſouls of perſons that are juſtified before God, which muſt be purged away by ſuffering temporal puniſhments in their Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65519:99"/>
then certainly neither was their inward habitual righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs perfect, and ſo could not juſtifie them before God, but needed a juſtification and pardon it ſelf, and ſo their juſtification of their perſons before God, is overthrown by this their covetous Doctrine of Purgatory; nor was their outward actual righteouſneſs or good works meritorious of eternal life, but rather for the ſin in them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved eternal death. If believers in this life can both for matter and manner in their own perſons keep and fulfill the whole Moral Law (as they plead they can) then this their caſting off their ſouls into Purgatory to be purged from ſome <hi>venial ſins</hi> committed in their life-time here in the body, which were not ſufficiently purged here (as they ſay) muſt needs fall to the ground; and therefore they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their forementioned Doctrines of Juſtification, Merits and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Law, or renounce this of Purgatory, which overthrows them; for this <hi>Dilemma</hi> will puſh them with one horn, or both; if they ſay, that their inherent righteouſneſs is <hi>perfect,</hi> then they deſtroy their pretended foundation for their Purgatory; then there will be no ſins remaining to be purged in Purgatory; if they ſay, that their inherent righteouſneſs is imperfect, then I ſay, they deſtroy, their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification before God by their own inherent righteouſneſs; for <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi> righteouſneſs cannot juſtifie them in the ſight of God, but will ſtand in need of a perfect righteouſneſs to procure a pardon for, and cover its imperfectneſs; if they affirm that imperfect righteouſneſs will juſtifie mens perſons before God, then they plainly <hi>deny Chriſt,</hi> and ſay in effect (whatſoever they pretend to the contrary) that there was no need of his coming into the world, and doing and ſuffering what he did; for 'tis yielded, that men by the light of nature, the ſtudy of Moral Philoſophy, and good education and obſervation, have attained to great meaſures of Moral Juſtice, which yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtifies them before God (as our <hi>13th</hi> Article undeniably proves, of which I ſpake before) nor ſaves them, as our <hi>18th</hi> Article plainly <note place="margin">John 3. 3.

               <p>Now that the puniſhment due to the offence or offender by Gods Law, is forgiven, when the offence is forgiven; I prove thus: 1.

To ſay, that God hath forgiven true believers all their ſins, and yet puniſh them for them with temporal puniſhment properly ſo called, in Purgatory, for the ſatisfying of his juſtice, is undeniably <hi>to aſcribe injuſtice to God,</hi> who is juſtice it ſelf; ſeeing this way they teach, <hi>that God doth puniſh the ſoul that hath no ſin, only becauſe it formerly had ſin, which he hath for Chriſt's ſake fully forgiven</hi>

               <p>Now from this ſound Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I hope I may have leave without offence to our <hi>Heyliniſts,</hi> to prove the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceſſively to be the Antichriſt the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture writes of: As thus:</p>
               <p>He that under the pretence of Religion, being the Servant, the Vicar of Chriſt, and the Succeſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> is the Inventor and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter up of Superſtitious and Phariſaical Sects, which are againſt the Word of God, and the glory of his name; that challengeth and exerciſeth Princely dominion over <hi>Nations and people,</hi> and <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Church of Chriſt,</hi> which is his Kingdom, <hi>whoſe uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped authority hath no good ground in holy Scripture;</hi> that <hi>produceth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian fruits, practiſes and doctrines;</hi> affirming, <hi>that a man can by his own works take away and purge his own ſin, and juſtifie himſelf; and</hi> denying this Doctrine, <hi>that a man is juſtified alone by faith;</hi> That is the <hi>Babylonical beaſt,</hi> that is the <hi>ſucceſſor of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, the ſpoiler and deſtroyer of Chriſts Church, the inſtrument and miniſter of Satan, the head of that Antichriſtian, Babylonical Sect,</hi> which ſay of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (that is the true Church of God) <hi>Down with it, even to the ground; whoſe Religion is rebellion, whoſe Faith is faction, and whoſe practiſe is murdering of ſouls and bodies;</hi> is not to be accounted a Chriſtian man, the Vicar of Chriſt, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> but an adverſary to Chriſt and his Goſpel; That is Antichriſt, the Antichriſt the holy Scripture writes of: But the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceſſively is ſo, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> therefore he is the Antichriſt the holy Scripture writes of. The major is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The Minor is alſo very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved in every particular by Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> in his Learned, and Elaborate, and Ingenious Book, called, <hi>The Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> which deſerves ſeriouſly to be read, and compared with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65519:107"/>
and practiſes of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The full proof of the Minor would take in the whole Body of Popery, which is learnedly confuted by Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in his <hi>Bellarminus Enervatus, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Hommius</hi> in his ſeven Theological Diſputations againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and others. Yet I ſhall take the pains to ſet down ſome of the heads, and leave you to apply them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Pope of Rome is not</hi> (as he pretends to be) <hi>Chriſts Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car General here on earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not prove that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is Chriſts Vicar General, either in Temporals or Spirituals, by Sacred Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt is ſuch an Head of his Church, that he needs not ſuch a Vicar on Earth as the Pope pretends to be; for Chriſt is God as well as Man, and is ever with his Church, and will be, even to the end of the world, <hi>Mat. 18. 20. Mat. 28. 20. Lo I am with you even to the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſet up the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Chriſts Vicar, is to deny Chriſts preſence with his Church. For a Vicar is one that doth ſupply the place of one that is abſent; and it is to deny Chriſt to be the Monarch of his Church, and ſaith in effect, that he is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and makes the Church of Chriſt, monſtrous <hi>Biceps,</hi> having two heads.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Officers that Chriſt hath appointed in his Church, are not his Vicars, but his <hi>Miniſters, Stewards, &amp;c.</hi> their Office is not Magiſterial, but only <hi>Miniſterial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. When Chriſt aſcended up into Heaven, he did not commit the Government of his Church Univerſal to one man, <hi>but to the whole Colledg or company, or ſociety of his Apoſtles,</hi> Joh. 20. 21. Chriſt ſaid to all his Apoſtles (except <hi>Thomas)</hi> that were alive, this, <hi>As my Father ſent me, even ſo ſend I you, &amp;c.</hi> Here Chriſt performed that which he promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16. 19. <hi>And I will give thee, &amp;c.</hi> That was but a promiſe of this gift, here Chriſt <hi>performed</hi> it to him, and <hi>to all his Diſciples,</hi> to whom in <hi>Peter</hi> the promiſe was made. Read alſo for this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. And when the Apoſtles died, they did <hi>not inſtitute one particular man</hi> over the whole Univerſal Church of Chriſt on Earth, but <hi>ordained fit men in every particular Church or Congregation of believers to rule it, and gave them authority, and a charge to govern it by common counſel;</hi> as ye may ſee was the practiſe of two Apoſtles, when they ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took their leave of the Churches, which they had planted, <hi>Act.</hi>

               <p>The Myſtery of the number 666 is to be found out by comparing it with the number 144, to which this number 666 is as it were the <hi>aut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>numerus,</hi> and muſt therefore be interpreted after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the ſame particulars applied to the Synagogue of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, as the number 144 ought to be applied to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now the myſtery of the number 144 (which is the number oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the number 666) conſiſts in the <hi>ſquare-root</hi> thereof, and and therefore the myſtery of the number 666 muſt be in the <hi>ſquare-root</hi> thereof alſo. But now to find out the true interpretation of this number 144, it's generally granted by all ancient and latter Interpreters, that the chief, if not the only cauſe why this number was choſen rather than any other number to be the meaſure of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65519:125"/>
wall of the Coeleſtial Jeruſalem, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 17. is, becauſe this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is raiſed and built upon the <hi>number</hi> 12, which being multiplied into it ſelf, produceth the <hi>ſquare-number</hi> 144. For as this number 144 is raiſed and built upon the number 12 only, and cannot poſſibly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any other number to be the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>baſis</hi> of it; ſo neither can the Church of Chriſt admit of any other <hi>foundation</hi> than that which is already laid by the 12 <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> As therefore this number 144 is built upon 12 Unities, ſo is the Church of Chriſt built upon the 12 <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> And as the number 12 is more conſpicuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in this number 144 than any other number, becauſe it meaſureth not only the bottom or <hi>root,</hi> but the <hi>ſides</hi> and <hi>ranks</hi> of it alſo; ſo it's evident, that the number of 12 is more conſpicuous and remarkable in the Church of God than any other number whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And hence it is, that this number 12 is repeated above 144 times in the Scriptures, and is in them ſo often uſed, and in ſo many and ſo divers particulars applied by the Spirit of God to things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Church, that we cannot but acknowledg this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be <hi>choſen,</hi> and as it were <hi>affected</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt, rather than any other. And though the number 144 may truly be ſaid to be <hi>Gods number</hi> rather than any other numbers, becauſe it repreſenteth the <hi>figure of the City,</hi> and in general the <hi>form and ſtructure of the Church</hi> and Hierarchy thereof; yet it cannot ſo properly be called Gods number, as the number 12, which almoſt in all material re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, is applicable to the Church, and <hi>is uſed</hi> in the Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, as <hi>numerus certus pro certo,</hi> and not as <hi>numerus certus pro incerto,</hi> in which ſenſe it muſt needs be granted that the number 144 doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And whereas the number 144 is no where mentioned in Scripture but in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. it muſt be granted, that it is not there to be the meaſure of the Wall (which doth in that place ſignifie the ſpiritual building of Gods Church) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there then were or at any time ſhould be preciſely. ſo many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And hence 'tis granted by Interpreters, that this number 144 was choſen to be the meaſure of the Wall of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for this reaſon chiefly, (if not only) <hi>becauſe it is the only ſquare-number which can be raiſed and

               <p>As Antichriſt is oppoſed to Chriſt, and as 666 is oppoſed to 144, ſo is 25 oppoſed to 12, ſo muſt thoſe things which are chiefly to be meaſured and numbred by this number 25 be correſpondent on the one ſide, and in ſome ſort oppoſed to, or ſet againſt thoſe things which are meaſured, numbred and deſcribed by the number 12.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The adminiſtration of Baptiſm</hi> was committed chiefly and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to them, and they were firſt commanded to <hi>go and baptize all Nations,</hi> and as it were by the 12 <hi>Gates</hi> of their Baptiſm to bring all true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the ſpiritual <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo at the firſt inſtitution of the Popes Cardinals, their <hi>office and commiſſion was chiefly to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,</hi> and they were fixed to certain Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> in which only Baptiſm was to be celebrated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles were to <hi>preach the Goſpel,</hi> and to plant Chriſtian Religion in all the world. So the <hi>Cardinals</hi> having quickly committed the celebration of Baptiſm to others, employed themſelves wholly to <hi>preach the Pope, and to plant and propagate Popery,</hi> in all Kingdoms of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles chief power <hi>to forgive and retain ſins;</hi> ſo likewiſe the Pope committed the chief care and diſpenſation of ſelling Pardons and Indulgences to his Cardinals, ſaying to them, as Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit, they are remitted; and whoſe ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> truly were and are the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of the Chriſtian Church, and all juriſdiction; ſo the <hi>Cardinals</hi> falſely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves to be, and truly they are <hi>the very baſis and foundation of the Romiſh Religion and Hierarchy;</hi> and therefore the root and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that ſuperſtition and impiety, which being derived origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from <hi>Rome,</hi> hath diffuſed it ſelf into all the Chriſtian world by them.</p>

               <p>As the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in reſpect of their ſpiritual Fatherhood, are fitly anſwerable to the 12 <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> who were the Fathers of all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> according to the fleſh; ſo the <hi>Pope's Cardinals</hi> are called <hi>Patres ſpirituales Eccleſiae.</hi>

               <p>Now its <hi>greater impiety and preſumption to add new Articles, than to reject the old.</hi> It more properly befits Antichriſt to deny the Faith, <hi>ex conſequenti &amp; indirecte,</hi> than to renounce the external profeſſion of it.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65519:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For the <hi>mouth of Antichriſt</hi> ought to be as a <hi>fountain ſending forth ſweet and bitter waters;</hi> he is to <hi>have a form of godlineſs, but to deny the power of it.</hi> He is to pretend himſelf to be a Chriſtian, and to be built upon the true foundation of the Apoſtles, but he is alſo to overthrow this foundation upon which in ſome ſort he is and pretends to be built, by <hi>ſuperinducing damnable doctrines,</hi> ex conſequenti &amp; indirecte, <hi>contradicting and denying that faith which he doth externally profeſs.</hi> The Devils themſelves may make profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith to the ſame end that Antichriſt doth, that is, to <hi>deceive by it.</hi> And it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Devils do more certainly know and believe the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical truth of the Creed, than ſome Popes have done. Laſtly, the Papiſts themſelves cannot deny, but that their imaginary Antichriſt (who ſhall be as they pretend of the Tribe of * <hi>Dan)</hi> muſt believe, or at leaſt <note place="margin">Dr. P. <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, becauſe Antichriſt muſt be a ſingle perſon, a Jew that muſt kill</hi> Elias &amp; Enoch, <hi>as I find him alledged by Dr.</hi> C. <hi>of</hi> Schiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 81.</note> profeſs himſelf to believe ſo many of the Articles of the Creed as the <hi>Jews</hi> now do, or as may evidently be proved by the old Teſtament. By all which it is evident, <hi>that the external profeſſion of faith can no way priviledg the Pope from being Antichriſt, which was to come into the world,</hi> but rather it may be truly ſaid, that this external profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> ſuch a thing as could not but concur to his Conſtitution. For <hi>Antichriſtianiſm conſiſts in two parts, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an open, yet feigned and hypocritical profeſſion of Chriſtianity; the other a ſecret and indirect, yet a real and effectual everſion of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So this form of profeſſing the Faith above mentioned conſiſting of 25 Articles, of which 12 <hi>belong to the firſt, part, and 13 to the ſecond,</hi> may be fitly eſteemed a <hi>perfect ſum and character of Antichriſtianiſm.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this 'tis anſwered, that the Popes were not of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed number 25, as Chriſt was not numbred among the 12 Apoſtles, though he was an Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. but was their Lord and Maſter, and head.

                  <hi>The reaſon why the number 666 was choſen</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Potter) was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the only figure of this number is a perfect figure, perfectly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the city of</hi> Rome; <hi>as the number 144 was choſen, becauſe the figure of this number is a perfect figure perfectly repreſenting the city of</hi> Jeruſalem. For which he gives many reaſons, and proves what he ſaith by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations too many and large to be ſet down here, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the Papiſts in the world will never be able fully to anſwer;

to him for brevities ſake I muſt neceſſarily refer you. Thus far Mr. <hi>Potter</hi> of the Number of the Beaſt 666. I pray ſeriouſly read the Book, you'l find more in it than I can expreſs here. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> when he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it at firſt, he ſleighted it, and read it with much prejudice; but by that time he had read all of it, and read it again, he admired it as the excellenteſt piece that ever was Printed of that ſubject.</p>
               <p>By counting the Number 666 thus, you may find the riſe, body and ſeat of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>If the application of the Number 666, or its root 25, doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any other Church or City beſides <hi>Rome,</hi> it's no more than Dr. <hi>H.

Chriſt ordained no other element to be uſed in Baptiſm, but only water, whereunto when the word is joined, it is made (as St.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſaith) a full and perfect Sacrament; they being wiſer in their own conceit than Chriſt, think it is not well nor orderly done, unleſs they uſe conjuration, unleſs they hallow the water, unleſs there be oyl, ſalt, ſpittle, tapers,</hi> (why was the ſign of the Croſs left out) <hi>and ſuch other dumb ceremonies, ſerving to no uſe, contrary to the plain rule of St.</hi> Paul, 1 Cor. 14. <hi>who willed all things to be done in the Church unto edification. Chriſt ordained the authority of the Keys to excommunicate notorious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to abſolve them which are truly penitent; they abuſe this power at their own pleaſure, as well in curſing the godly with bell, book and candle, as alſo abſolving the reprobate, which are known to be unworthy of any Chriſtian ſociety, whereof they that liſt may ſee examples, let them ſearch their lives.

The Gentiles (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> which ſeem to be of the purer Religion, ſay, We worſhip not the Images, but by the corporal Images, we do behold the ſigns of the things which we ought to worſhip. And <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith, the Gentiles ſay,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65519:145"/>
we fear not the Images, but them after whoſe likeneſſes the Images be made, and to whoſe names they be conſecrated. And <hi>Clemens</hi> ſaith, that Serpent the Devil uttereth theſe words by the mouth of certain men, We to the honour of the inviſible God, worſhip viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Images, which ſurely is not falſe.

For notwithſtanding this excuſe, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Lactantius,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> prove them Idolaters. And the Scriptures ſay, they worſhip ſtocks and ſtones (notwithſtanding this excuſe) even as our Image-mongers do. And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> therefore calleth the gods of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſtocks and ſtones, although they were but Images of their gods. So are our Images of God and the Saints named by the names of God and his Saints, after the uſe of the Gentiles. What ſhould it mean that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as did the Gentile-Idolaters, light Candles at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, or at midnight before them, but therewith to honour them? for other uſe is none of ſo doing; for in the day it needeth not, but was ever a Proverb of fooliſhneſs, to light a candle at noon-day. And in the night it availeth not to light a candle before the blind, and God hath neither uſe nor honour thereof. By which it appeareth, that <note place="margin">Are not Tapers appearances of the ſame Religion to be abſtained from, as well as candles?</note> we do agree with the Gentile-Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in our Candle-Religion.</q>

And 1. concerning preaching, if it ſhould be admitted, that although Images were ſuffered in Churches, yet might Idolatry by diligent and ſincere preaching of Gods Word be avoided; it ſhould follow of neceſſity, that ſincere Doctrine might always be had, and continue as well as Images, and ſo that whereſoever; to offence, were erected an Image, there alſo of reaſon a godly and ſincere Preacher ſhould and might be continually maintained; for it is reaſon that the warning be as common as the ſtumbling-block, the

Wherefore preaching cannot ſtay Idolatry, Images being publickly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.

But a true Preacher to ſtay this miſchief, is in very many places ſcarcely heard in one whole year, and ſome where not once in ſeven years, as is evident to be proved.

                     <hi>Homily of Almeſdeeds,</hi> Tom. 2. p. 159, 160, 161. where it ſaith thus: <hi>The ſame Leſſon doth the Holy Ghoſt alſo teach in ſundry places of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> (quoting <hi>Tob.</hi> 4. in the Margent,) <hi>ſaying, mercifulneſs and almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving purgeth from all ſins, and delivereth from death, and ſuffereth not the ſoul to come into darkneſs.</hi> Now to this the Ch. of <hi>England</hi> there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, <hi>That Almeſdeeds purge not from ſin, as the the original cauſe of our acceptance before God; or that for the dignity or worthineſs thereof our ſins are waſhed away, and we purged and cleanſed of all the ſpots of our iniquities, for that were to deface Chriſt, and defraud him of glory; but they mean this, and this is the meaning of thoſe and ſuch ſayings, that God of his mercy and of his favour towards them whom he hath appointed to everlaſting ſalvation, hath ſo offered his grace, eſpecially, and they have ſo received it fruitfully, that although by reaſon of their ſinful living out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, they ſeemed before to have been the children of wrath and perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet now the Spirit of God mightily worketh in them unto obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods will and commandments; they declare by their outward deeds and life, in the ſhewing of mercy and charity (which cannot come but of the Spirit of God, and his ſpecial grace) that they are the undoubted children of God appointed to everlaſting life. 2. That the words are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the judgment of men:</hi> as the following words do declare, for that ſpeaks of the <hi>judgment of charity, and of men.

and our duty, have our ſins indeed waſhed away, and our offences blotted out, not for the worthineſs of them, but by the grace of God, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all in all, and that for the promiſe that God hath made to them that are obedient to his Commandments. Almeſdeeds do waſh away ſins, becauſe God doth vouchſafe to repute us as clean and pure, when we do them for his fake, and not becauſe they do merit or deſerve our purging, or for that they have any ſuch ſtrength or virtue in themſelves.</hi> Homily of Almſdeed, Tom. 2.

King <hi>James</hi> his words at the Conference at <hi>Hampton-</hi>Court, yet being well conſidered, they make nothing for their falſe Doctrine, [That <hi>truly juſtified perſons may totally and finally fall away from the acts and habit of ſaving Grace]</hi> but rather againſt it. For,</p>

               <p n="4">4.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65519:168"/>
then it will follow, that Gods knowledg is very confuſed and uncertain; that he doth not diſtinctly and certainly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this or that man will or ſhall believe in Chriſt, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in holineſs; and that therefore he doth but <hi>conditionally</hi> elect him to eternal Salvation, viz. <hi>if he do believe in Chriſt,</hi> and perſevere; and not <hi>peremptorily,</hi> until he ſee him do ſo; and then it will follow that God is not omniſcient and that there is a ſeparable accident in God; and that God is <hi>compounded of ſubject and accident,</hi> and not a perfect and ſimple eſſence, and ſo not God; which is contrary to Sacred Scripture, <hi>Job. 6. 64. But there are ſome of you that believe not; for Jeſus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who ſhould betray him.</hi> And 2 Tim. 2. 19. <hi>Nevertheleſs the foundation of God standeth ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> Which two places of Scripture do plainly ſhew that the Lord doth diſtinctly and certainly know who are elected, and who are reprobated, and who would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and who would not believe in him, and this too, <hi>from the beginning.</hi> And their Doctrine of <hi>reſiſtibility,</hi> viz. <hi>that the will of Gods elect can finally reſiſt Gods will,</hi> denies conſequentially Gods Omnipotence, and makes man ſtronger than God, which is contrary to that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh. 10. 29, 30. My Father which gave them me, is greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand; I and my Father are one.</hi> And ſo they run direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt King <hi>James</hi> his words, which they have brought out of the Conference at <hi>Hampton-</hi>Court before mentioned; where he willed, That <hi>the Doctrine of Predeſtination ſhould be handled tenderly, leſt Gods Omnipotence ſhould be called in queſtion.</hi> 3.
